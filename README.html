<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>The decision to use a Makefile is a conscious one. Every project
needs some sort of top-level driver; Makefiles and <cite>ant</cite> build scripts are common
choices. While it would be possible to express <em>everything</em> in the XProc pipeline,
doing so would require extension steps that would make the pipeline less portable and consequently
seemlingly less appropriate for an “open standards” solution.</p>

<p>It would also be possible to entirely eliminate the Makefile by
simply listing the commands that must be run in order to produce the ePUB
file, but it seems silly to impose such an inconvenience.</p>

<p>In order to build the ePUB file, you must have an XProc processor and some version of
the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/epubcheck/">EpubCheck</a> tool. These dependencies
are highlighted as variables at the top of the Makefile.</p>

<h2>Strategy</h2>

<p>An ePUB file consists of three significant artifacts: a collection of HTML documents which
form the content of the book, NCX and OPF documents that are metadata descriptions of the
content, and any other ancillary files (images, CSS stylesheets, etc.) used in the book.</p>

<p>In this submission, <cite>tei2html.xsl</cite> converts TEI to HTML to construct the
colleciton of HTML documents; <cite>tei2ncx.xsl</cite> and <cite>tei2opf.xsl</cite> construct
the metadata dscriptions, <cite>tei2cover.xsl</cite> produces a cover/titlepage;
<cite>tei2endnotes.xsl</cite> produces end notes, if they're used; and the
ancillary files are simply copied into place.</p>

<p>The HTML transformations included in this submission handle all of the markup present in
the <cite>Millioenenstudien</cite> but are nowhere near complete or even broadly useful
for general TEI conversions. Where practical, the stylistic conventions in the text
(italics, bold, letter-spacing) are pushed down to the CSS level so that they're easier
to modify for presentation. The same is true of the page breaks which are displayed by
default but could easily be suppressed with CSS.</p>

<p>Absent a detailed spec for the markup, I've taken educated guesses in many cases.
For example, I assume that <code>rend="i"</code> signals italics and
<code>rend="bq"</code> signals a block quote, etc.</p>

<p>Footnotes pose the most significant design challenge. I
experimented with three options: notes inline, floating to the right;
notes inline, below the paragraph that contains the note; and end
notes.</p>

<p>When the notes were “floated right”, getting the note text properly
aligned (vertically) with the note reference seemed impractical. Before long, I concluded
that it was just not aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>Putting the notes inline, below the paragraph in which they occur isn't too bad.
It has the advantage the the text is near the reference. It has two obvious disadvantages: the
note text is somewhat “intrusive” in the document and in paginated readers, the note is occasionally
on the next page. On the whole, I think the result is imperfect but aesthetically acceptable.</p>

<p>The final approach, making all the notes appear at the end, linking the reference to the note
and vice versa, removes the disadvantages of putting them inline, at the cost of moving them
a long way from the reference. It's also unfortunate that in paged readers, the cross references
take you only to the correct page, not to the point of reference as we're used to in scrolling
media. Again, I think the result is imperfect but aesthetically acceptable.</p>

<p>The solution submitted leaves the choice up to you. If you build with ENDNOTES=1 in the Makefile,
you'll get end notes. If you build with ENDNOTES=0, you'll get inline notes.</p>

<h3>Chunking</h3>

<p>In designing an XProc+XSLT solution, there's another design decision to be made: do you chunk
in XSLT, processing the entire TEI document in a single stylesheet that produces a sequence of
chapter chunks, or do you chunk in XProc, using <code>p:for-each</code> to loop over the chapters?</p>

<p>I chose the latter, mostly because it seemed to exercise XProc in a more interesting way.
That decision ripples through in various ways. For example, the end notes are generated with a
separate stylesheet. If I'd chosen the former approach, the end notes could have been generated
by the stylesheet that processed the documents.</p>

<h3>Normalization</h3>

<p>One aspect of TEI to HTML conversion that has to be addressed is the discrepancy between
what is allowed in TEI and what is allowed in HTML. In particular, while TEI allows block
elements (such as figures, block quotations, and poems), HTML does not.</p>

<p>I address this issue by preprocessing, or normalizing, the TEI
sources. The <cite>normalize.xsl</cite> stylesheet adds ID values to
elements that will need to be referenced later and lifts block
elements out of paragraphs. This may or may not be an entirely
TEI-valid intermediate form, but it is sufficient to guarantee that we
get valid XHTML.</p>

<h3>Text Cleanup</h3>

<p>The TEI sources contain some odd markup, most obviously a large number of paragraphs
that contain a single non-breaking space. These are the sorts of things one comes to expect
from OCRed sources, but inspection of the
<a href="http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mult001mill01_01/">DBNL version</a> of the text allows
us to make some inference about what is intended.</p>

<p>In the transformation, I've attempted to render as many of these
constructions as possible in aesthetically pleasing ways. For example,
the empty paragraphs seem to coincide with the authors desire to have
a mixture of block-style paragraphs separated by blank lines and
indented-style paragraphs without blank lines. That's reflected in the
ePUB through CSS rather than extra markup.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Using only the standard XProc and XSLT languages (with a little convenience scaffolding in
a Makefile), this submission converts the supplied TEI sources to a valid ePUB book.</p>
