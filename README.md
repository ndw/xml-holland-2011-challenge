# XML Holland 2011 Challenge

This repository constitutes my entry into the
[XML Holland 2011 Challenge](http://xmlholland.nl/codechallenge). It is a rather
lame attempt in comparison to
[Geert](https://twitter.com/#!/grtjn)'s excellent
[winning entry](https://github.com/grtjn/xproc-ebook-conv).

You can try it out by running *either* the `Makefile` or the `build.xml`. You don't
need both.

Share and enjoy. And congrats again to Geert!
